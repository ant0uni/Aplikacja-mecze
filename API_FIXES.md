## üî¥ Problems Identified

Based on the [SportMonks Football API v3 Documentation](https://docs.sportmonks.com/football/), the following issues were found in the application:

### 1. **Fixtures Route Issues**

#### Problem:
- ‚ùå Using `/fixtures` endpoint without proper date filtering
- ‚ùå Passing dates as query parameters instead of URL path segments
- ‚ùå Missing `scores` include for match scores

#### Solution:
- ‚úÖ Changed to use `/livescores` endpoint (available on FREE plans)
- ‚úÖ Shows fixtures from 15 minutes before kickoff to 15 minutes after finish
- ‚úÖ Added client-side date filtering since livescores doesn't support date params
- ‚úÖ Added `scores` to includes for proper score data
- ‚úÖ Increased per_page to 100 to get more matches

**Correct Endpoint Format (FREE PLAN):**
```
https://api.sportmonks.com/v3/football/livescores?api_token={TOKEN}
```

**IMPORTANT - Free Plan Limitations:**
- ‚úÖ No includes needed - base data contains participants and scores
- ‚úÖ Participants (teams) are in base response
- ‚úÖ Scores are in base response  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è League/State/Venue names may not be included (only IDs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some includes may not be available on free plans

**Note**: The livescores endpoint shows:
- Fixtures starting in the next 15 minutes
- Currently live fixtures
- Fixtures that ended in the last 15 minutes

For historical or future fixtures beyond this window, you need a paid plan with access to `/fixtures/between/{start}/{end}`.

### 2. **Teams Route Issues**

#### Problem:
- ‚ùå Using old filter syntax: `filter[name]` and `filter[country_id]`
- ‚ùå This syntax is from API v2, not compatible with v3
- ‚ùå No error logging for API failures

#### Solution:
- ‚úÖ Changed to use dynamic filters: `filters=teamSearch:{search_term}`
- ‚úÖ Removed unsupported `filter[country_id]` parameter
- ‚úÖ Added proper error logging with response text
- ‚úÖ Maintained pagination and includes

**Correct Filter Format:**
```
https://api.sportmonks.com/v3/football/teams?api_token={TOKEN}&filters=teamSearch:Arsenal&include=country
```

### 3. **Leagues Route Issues**

#### Problem:
- ‚ùå No error handling for failed requests
- ‚ùå Missing error details in logs

#### Solution:
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error logging
- ‚úÖ Log error response text from API
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up unnecessary filter logic

### 4. **Fixture Detail Route Issues**

#### Problem:
- ‚ùå Passing unnecessary `Accept` header (API doesn't require it)
- ‚ùå Using inconsistent variable name (`fixtureId` vs `numericId`)

#### Solution:
- ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary headers
- ‚úÖ Fixed variable naming consistency
- ‚úÖ API token passed as query parameter only

## ÔøΩ Subscription Plan Issues

**Important:** Not all SportMonks endpoints are available on all subscription plans.

### Free/Basic Plans
- ‚úÖ `/livescores` - Live and recent matches
- ‚úÖ `/fixtures/{id}` - Single fixture by ID
- ‚ùå `/fixtures/between/{start}/{end}` - May not be available
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/fixtures` - Limited data, may only show recent fixtures

### Premium Plans
- ‚úÖ All endpoints including `/between` for date ranges
- ‚úÖ Historical data
- ‚úÖ More includes and filters

### Our Solution
The fixtures API now uses a **cascading fallback approach**:

1. **First Try**: `/fixtures/between/{start}/{end}` (best for date filtering)
2. **Fallback 1**: `/livescores` (shows live and recent matches)
3. **Fallback 2**: `/fixtures` (basic fixture list)

This ensures the app works regardless of your subscription plan.

### How to Check Your Plan
1. Log in to [SportMonks Dashboard](https://www.sportmonks.com/)
2. Check your subscription details
3. View available endpoints in your plan

### Recommended Approach
- **Development/Testing**: Use livescores endpoint (works on free plans)
- **Production**: Upgrade to a plan with `/between` endpoint support

## ÔøΩ Key API v3 Requirements (FREE PLAN)

### Authentication
- API token MUST be passed as query parameter: `?api_token={YOUR_TOKEN}`
- No special headers required

### Fixtures Endpoint for Free Plans
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use livescores (FREE PLAN)
/livescores?api_token={TOKEN}&include=participants,league,state,scores

// ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE on free plan
/fixtures/between/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{YYYY-MM-DD}
```

**Important for Free Plans:**
- Livescores only shows matches from -15 minutes to +15 minutes of kickoff
- No historical data
- No future fixtures beyond 15 minutes
- Client-side filtering applied for dates and leagues

### Filter Syntax
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - API v3 dynamic filters
?filters=teamSearch:Arsenal
?filters=statisticTypes:42,49

// ‚ùå WRONG - API v2 syntax
?filter[name]=Arsenal
?filter[country_id]=462
```

### Include Syntax
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Note: 'participant' is SINGULAR
?include=participant,league,state

// ‚ùå WRONG - These will cause 404 errors
?include=participants  // Must be singular!
?include=scores        // Scores are in base data, not an include
```

**Critical**: SportMonks API v3 uses **singular** names for includes:
- `participant` NOT `participants`
- `score` entities are in base fixture data
- Check docs for each endpoint's valid includes

### Pagination
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
?page=1&per_page=50

// Note: Maximum may vary by subscription plan
```

### Client-Side Filtering (Our API Layer)
Since SportMonks FREE plan has limited filtering capabilities, we handle filters in our API layer:

```typescript
// Supported by our API (filtered after fetching from SportMonks):
?dateFrom=2024-10-25&dateTo=2024-10-28  // Client-side date filtering
?leagueIds=8,9,10  // Comma-separated league IDs
?sortBy=starting_at  // Field to sort by
?order=asc  // asc or desc

// These are applied AFTER fetching from SportMonks
// Note: Date filtering on free plan only works within livescores window (-15 to +15 minutes)
```

**Important**: All filtering and sorting happens in our API layer because SportMonks free plan livescores endpoint doesn't support query parameters for filtering.

## üö® Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: 400 Bad Request
**Cause:** Using wrong filter syntax or invalid parameters
**Solution:** Use dynamic filters format: `filters=entitySingular:values`

### Error: 401 Unauthorized
**Cause:** Missing or invalid API token
**Solution:** Check `SPORTMONKS_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`

### Error: 422 Unprocessable Entity
**Cause:** Date format incorrect or date range > 100 days
**Solution:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format, max 100 days range

### Error: 404 Not Found
**Cause:** `/between` endpoint not available on your subscription plan
**Solution:** The API now automatically falls back to:
1. First tries: `/fixtures/between/{start}/{end}` (premium feature)
2. Falls back to: `/livescores` (available on most plans)
3. Final fallback: `/fixtures` (basic endpoint)

Check your SportMonks subscription plan to see which endpoints are available.

### No Data Returned
**Cause:** Date range might not have fixtures or subscription limits
**Solution:** Try different date range or check subscription plan
