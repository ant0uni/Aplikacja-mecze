## UI Components Created

### Table Component (`components/ui/table.tsx`)
- Reusable table component for displaying data

- Used for standings and top scorers displays

## Image Handling Strategy

### Implementation Details:
- **Method**: Standard HTML `<img>` tags (not Next.js Image component)
- **Reason**: Better compatibility with third-party APIs like SofaScore
- **Error Handling**: 
  ```tsx
  onError={(e) => {
    const target = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
    target.style.display = 'none';
  }}
  ```
- **Fallback**: Team initials in colored boxes when images fail to load

## Navigation Structure

## Features Not Yet Implemented

### Available but Not Implemented:
1. **Match Lineups** - Requires event ID (may not work for all matches)
2. **Match Statistics** - Detailed match stats (may not work for all matches)
3. **Live Match Events** - Goals, cards, substitutions
4. **Team Fixtures** - All matches for a specific team
5. **Player Details** - Individual player statistics and information
6. **Match Incidents** - Timeline of match events
7. **Team Statistics** - Team performance metrics

### Why Not Implemented:
- **Event-specific data** (lineups, statistics, incidents): Only available for matches in progress or completed, returns 404 for upcoming/scheduled matches
- **Time constraints**: Focus was on getting the most valuable features working
- **API limitations**: Some endpoints may require different access levels

## Technical Notes

### API Base URLs:
- **Events/Fixtures**: `https://www.sofascore.com/api/v1/`
- **Images & Standings**: `https://api.sofascore.com/api/v1/`

### Date Format:
- ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Timestamps: Unix timestamps (seconds)

### Sorting Logic:
Two-level sorting implemented on dashboard:
1. **Primary**: Predictable matches first (status.code === 0)
2. **Secondary**: User-selected criteria (date, league name, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Top Assists** - Similar to top scorers but for assists
2. **Team Form** - Last 5 matches for teams
3. **Player Comparison** - Compare stats between players
4. **Match Predictions** - Based on historical data
5. **Favorite Teams** - Track specific teams
6. **Notifications** - Match reminders and score updates

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- **Client-side fetching**: All API calls from browser
- **No caching**: Fresh data on every page load
- **Image optimization**: Standard img tags with error handling

### Recommendations:
- Consider implementing SWR or React Query for data caching
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Add API rate limiting handling
